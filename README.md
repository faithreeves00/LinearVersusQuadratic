# Linear Versus Quadratic
Utilizes FaithsHashTable to process, store, and compare data using linear and quadratic probing. 
FaithsHashTable is a Hashtable class that stores data by mapping keys to values. Linear and Quadratic probing are supported to solve collisions.

# Input 
A dictionary file (dictionary.txt) full of numeric data is used to test each mehtod of probing within the Hashtable.

# Output
The load factor (the number of elements divided by the target table size) is displayed. It begins at 50% and is increased by 5% for each iteration. 
The number of Linear and Quadratic probe inserations without collisons are displayed as well as the collison count for each respective iteration and probing technique.
